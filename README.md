Block Utility adds quick actions for Markdown fences in Obsidian. It understands code fences (```...``` and ~~~...~~~), math fences (both $$...$$ blocks and inline $...$), inline code, inline emphasis (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight), and the release-tool info fences (:::box-info / :::tag-info / :::latex) as well as other :::-style fences. You can copy, select, remove, or wrap content without manually managing delimiters.

## Commands

- Copy fenced content under cursor
- Select fenced content under cursor
- Remove fences around content under cursor
- Wrap selection with :::box-info fence
- Wrap selection with :::tag-info fence
- Wrap selection with :::latex fence
